                    <p> <a href = "#"><big>Pinkerton</big></a>is the second <a href = "#"> second album</a> album by the American rock band Weezer, released on September 24, 1996, by <a href = "#">DGC Records</a>. To better capture their live sound, the band self-produced Pinkerton, creating a darker, more abrasive album than their 1994 debut <a href = "#">Weezer</a>. The lyrics express loneliness and disillusionment with the rock lifestyle, and reference Japanese culture. Pinkerton produced the singles <a href = "#">"El Scorcho"</a> and <a href = "#">"The Good Life"</a>. It debuted at number 19 on the <a href = "#">Billboard 200</a> , failing to match sales of Weezer's debut, and received mixed reviews; <a href = "#">Rolling Stone</a> readers voted it the third-worst album of 1996. For subsequent albums, Weezer returned to more traditional pop songwriting and less personal lyrics. In subsequent years, Pinkerton was reassessed; several publications named it one of the best albums of the 1990s, and it was <a href = "#">certified platinum</a>certified platinum in 2016.

The oil-on-canvas work depicts a young couple on an excursion outside a city, walking on a woodland path. Influenced by the <a href = "#">Rococo Revival</a> style during the <a href = "#">Second French Empire</a>, the work reflects the older style and themes of eighteenth-century artists like <a href = "#">Jean-Honoré Fragonard</a> and <a href = "#">Antoine Watteau</a>. It also shows the influence of <a href = "#">Claude Monet</a> on Renoir's new approach to painting. La Promenade now hangs in the <a href = "#">Getty Center</a> in Los Angeles, California.</p>
